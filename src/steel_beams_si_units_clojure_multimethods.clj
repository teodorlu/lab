;; > Flexible software must be more flexible than all known cases.
;;
;; I'm paraphrasing [Software Design for Flexibility] by [Chris Hanson] and [Gerald Jay Sussman] from memory, don't expect to find the exact quote.

;; [Software Design for Flexibility]: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility
;; [Chris Hanson]: https://people.csail.mit.edu/cph/
;; [Gerald Jay Sussman]: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/gjs.html
;;
;; I believe they are right.
;; Flexible systems must be more general than their application.
;; Otherwise the flexible system is not an abstraction, it's just a collection of code.
;;
;; ## Clojure is a flexible language
;;
;; In a discussion with a friend who enjoys programming greatly, I said "I don't really care about syntax".
;; That statement surprised him.
;; Frankly, the statement surprised me too.
;; Syntax isn't irrelevant.
;; But it's not _the goal_.
;; Some programming languages depend greatly on the syntax.
;; Others don't.
;;
;; Clojure establishes syntax for sequential data, associative data, sets, function calls and macro calls.

;; If you accept these five decisions about syntax, you can basically do whatever you want afterwards.

;; You can define your own functions, and your own macros.
;; `last` is defined as `clojure.core/last`, `set/union` is defined in `clojure.set/union.`
;; Let is a macro defined in `clojure.core/let`.
;; The only reason you can write `let` and have that automatically refer to `clojure.core/let` is `clojure.core` is required by default.
;; That default can be disabled.

;; Notice all the things that are missing from other languages?
;;
;; - Syntax for function definition - `fn` is a plain macro.
;; - Syntax for type definitions - you can choose a library for checking data
;;   (like [clojure spec] or [malli], _if_ you want.
;; - Syntax for for loops - `for` is a plain macro
;; - Syntax for while loops - `loop` and `reduce` are plain macros.
;;   You can use those, or write your own alternatives.
;; - Syntax for defining types: `deftype`, `defrecord` and `defprotocol` are macros.

;; This is good!
;; You don't even need all the stuff I mentioned above to get really far.
;; Take the time to learn and understand vectors (sequential data), maps (associative data), sets (unique elements only) and functions.
;; Idiomatic Clojure code is functions transforming data.
;; Leave the rest for when you actually need it!

;; Flexible languages can solve a wide variety of problems.
;; A problem you might pick for yourself is to design steel beams.

;; Though I'm able to evaluate things in the REPL.

;;
;; We can now represent 300 mm and preserve the unit:

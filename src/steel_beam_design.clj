;; # Steel beam resistance against bending moment
;;
;; _Exlplained with Clojure_.
;;
;; You're probably wondering why steel beams look like they do, and want an explanation for that in a nice, functional programming language.
;; You're in luck—that's what you'll be getting today!
;;
;; ## Vocabulary: cross section, web and flange
;;
;; First, let us define our vocabulary.
;;
;; This is a _steel beam_:

;; This a figure of steel beam's _cross section_:

;; This steel beam is an _I-shape beam_.
;; I-shape beams have _flanges_ on the top and on the bottom, and a _web_ in the middle.
;; The flanges and the web are labelled on the figure above.
